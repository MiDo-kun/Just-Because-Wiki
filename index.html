                        Very similar animes. Tsuki ga Kirei could be seen as a version of Just Because! in middle school. Besides
               having the same atmosphere, the romance type is very close to the one observed in Just Because!. They
               seem very realistic and not sometimes overly comic and silly.

                        There are some similarities felt between the two, but that might be because the writer or the Seishun

                           I'm a romance seeker myself. I love to experience either pure vanilla or train wreck romance stories.
                  But then again, this one is neither of those two. The pace is non-existent and they seriously don't
                  even know what the hell is going on. Worse, it mixed up all kinds of aspects altogether, to the point
                  that I can pretty much say a chimera was born. The potential is wasted and the current story is not
                  even worth much. While this series is original, the premises themselves are just as generic as they
                  can get.

                           Pick a train to decide your future. You can’t say for sure what lies at your destination, but you know
                  for certain it will take you away from your school and friends you made there. This is the theme that
                  Just Because puts forward with its story of seniors deciding their futures and many train station
                  scenes. However, it does not have the intimacy necessary for these themes to be believable.

                           High school can be quite an experience for most young people these days. I remember a time during my
                  high school years when everything seems to feel different. It’s almost like setting foot into a new
                  world with new opportunities. Friends, activities, relationships. It’s a place beyond just about
                  learning but for people to build a future. While it isn’t like college for career building, it
                  definitely gives the chance for opportunities, even for relationships. For Eita Izumi, he comes back
                  from his hometown after 4 years as he reunites with his middle school friends.

                           the first episode throw me off little bit , but i decided to keep watching and so far its look pretty
                  heart warming , its my favorite type of slice of life anime, no exaggerated comedy , heart warming and
                  slow pacing , the character are little by too cliché, the love triangles and the unnecessary screaming
                  gets in the way of enjoying the anime, the art is great although there one thing that i find annoying
                  but
                  its opinion based which the finger nails color change in the close shots which is not exclusive to
                  this
                  anime but i find it annoying , but all in all its relatable and feels good to watch and i hope it
                  stays
                  this way...
